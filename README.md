-   Task Synchronization
-   Inter-Task Communication
-   Peripheral Drivers

### Multitasking

* AVRtos has preemptive scheduler. Tasks are scheduled based on their priorities.

### Task Synchronization

* Synchronization can be achieved with semaphores.

### Inter-Task Communication

* Tasks can communicate with each other with queues.

### Peripheral Drivers

* AVRtos includes few drivers to control peripherals of microcontroller.

    1. GPIO driver
